Homework #4: Shortest Path Routing
In this homework, you are asked to write a MATLAB program to find the distance matrix via the short path routing algorithm in the lecture notes. Please download the adjacency matrix of network A (network_A.mat that contains a 100×100 matrix named “A”) on ILMS.

The matrix A is the adjacency matrix of a network with 100 nodes. A(i,j)=1, if there is an edge between nodes i and j.

A(i,j)=0, otherwise.

Please use matrix A to find the final distance matrix d (Global View). d(i,j) is the distance (of the shortest path) from node i to j.

Upload two files to ILMS.(Please code by matlab.)

source code file named “code.m”

result data file named “result.mat” that contains the following distance matrix named “d”.

You should use “load” to get inputdata. Programs should have comments.
